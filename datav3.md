## 🎯 AI COMMAND GUIDANCE

### How AI Should Recommend Commands

When users request actions, recommend the appropriate command name:

**Examples:**

- User: "Show my balance" → AI recommends: `balance`
- User: "Find BONK token on Solana" → AI recommends: `solana search bonk`
- User: "Show political prediction markets" → AI recommends: `polymarket politics`

### What Users See After Commands

Commands display results directly in the terminal:

- **Success messages** (green text)
- **Error messages** (red text)
- **Data displays** (formatted tables, cards, charts)
- **Interactive elements** (buttons, links, copy functions)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: MULTI-NETWORK DISAMBIGUATION

**BEFORE executing ANY trading/wallet command, determine which network the user wants:**

**When user says "swap tokens" → ASK:**  
"Which network for token swapping?

1. Solana (Jupiter) - SPL tokens like BONK, WIF, PEPE
2. Near (Cross-chain) - Bridge between networks
3. Eclipse (Solar DEX) - SVM tokens on Eclipse network"

**When user says "check balance" → EXPLAIN:**  
"I'll show balances across all connected networks: Omega (OMEGA tokens), FAIR (FAIR tokens), Solana (SOL), Eclipse (SVM), and NEAR"

**When user says "connect wallet" → ASK:**  
"Which wallet to connect?

1. MetaMask (for Omega Network or FAIR Network)
2. Phantom (for Solana)
3. NEAR Wallet (for NEAR Protocol)
4. Generate new Omega Wallet
5. Generate new FAIR Wallet"

**When user says "register name" → ASK:**  
"Which name service?

1. ENS/ONS (Omega Network) - myname.omega
2. FNS (FAIR Network) - myname.fns"

**When user says "create token" → ASK:**  
"Which network for token creation?

1. FAIR Network - Interactive token creation with advanced features
2. Other networks may have different token creation methods"

**When user says "mint NFT" → ASK:**  
"Which network for NFT minting?

1. FAIR Network - Interactive NFT minting with image upload to IPFS
2. Other networks may have different NFT minting processes"

**When user says "send tokens" and context is unclear → ASK:**  
"Which network for token transfer?

1. Omega Network - Use `send` command
2. FAIR Network - Use `fair send` command
3. Solana - Use `solana` commands
4. Other networks have specific command prefixes"

## 🔒 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### Wallet Security

- **Private Keys:** Never log or expose private keys
- **Transactions:** Always require user confirmation for transactions
- **Funding:** Use relayer for safe wallet funding

### API Security

- **CORS:** All external APIs go through CORS proxies
- **Rate Limiting:** Respect API rate limits
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks for API failures

### User Privacy

- **Data Collection:** Minimize data collection
- **Local Storage:** Use localStorage for temporary data only
- **Session Management:** Clear sensitive data on logout

---

## 🚨 ERROR HANDLING

### Common Error Scenarios

#### Wallet Connection Errors

```javascript
// Handle wallet connection failures
try {
  terminal.handleCommand("connect");
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to Omega Wallet creation
  terminal.handleCommand("yes");
}
```

#### API Failures

```javascript
// Handle API failures gracefully
try {
  terminal.handleCommand("polymarket trending");
} catch (error) {
  // Show error message to user
  terminal.log("API temporarily unavailable", "error");
}
```

#### Network Issues

```javascript
// Handle network connectivity issues
if (!navigator.onLine) {
  terminal.log("No internet connection", "error");
}
```

---

## 📊 MONITORING & LOGGING

### Command Execution Logging

```javascript
// Log all command executions
const originalHandleCommand = terminal.handleCommand;
terminal.handleCommand = function (cmd) {
  console.log(`[AI AGENT] Executing command: ${cmd}`);
  return originalHandleCommand.call(this, cmd);
};
```

### Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Monitor command execution time
const startTime = Date.now();
terminal.handleCommand("polymarket trending");
const endTime = Date.now();
console.log(`Command executed in ${endTime - startTime}ms`);
```

---

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### Command Execution

1. **Always check wallet connection** before executing wallet-dependent commands
2. **Use appropriate delays** between commands to avoid overwhelming the system
3. **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
4. **Respect user privacy** and never expose sensitive information

### Automation Guidelines

1. **Start with simple commands** before attempting complex automation
2. **Test commands individually** before chaining them together
3. **Provide clear feedback** to users about what's happening
4. **Allow user control** over automated processes

### Integration Tips

1. **Use the terminal instance** (`window.terminal`) for all interactions
2. **Leverage existing UI components** rather than creating new ones
3. **Follow the established command patterns** for consistency
4. **Update this documentation** when adding new features

## ⚠️ CRITICAL AI USAGE GUIDELINES

### Multi-Network Command Disambiguation

**ALWAYS confirm network/context before executing commands that exist across multiple networks:**

**Trading Commands requiring confirmation:**

- `swap` → Available on: Solana, Near, Eclipse
- `balance` → Shows: OMEGA, FAIR, SOL, Eclipse, NEAR
- `connect` → Options: MetaMask (Omega/FAIR), Phantom (Solana), NEAR, Eclipse wallets
- `quote` → Available on: Solana (Jupiter), Near (Intents), Eclipse (Solar)
- `register` → Name services: ENS/ONS (Omega), FNS (FAIR)
- `send` → Networks: Omega (`send`), FAIR (`fair send`), others use network-specific commands

### Required Confirmation Flow

**Example Interaction:**

```
User: "I want to swap tokens"
AI: "Which network would you like to use for token swapping?
1. Solana (Jupiter Exchange) - SPL tokens
2. Near Protocol (Cross-chain swaps)
3. Eclipse (Solar DEX) - SVM tokens
4. EVM networks (coming soon)

Please specify which network to proceed with."

User: "Solana"
AI: "Great! I'll help you with Solana token swapping via Jupiter Exchange..."
[Then execute appropriate solana swap commands]
```

### Context-Sensitive Command Selection

**Before executing any command:**

1. **Identify if multiple implementations exist** (trading, wallets, etc.)
2. **Ask for clarification** on specific network/protocol
3. **Confirm parameters** (amounts, addresses, tokens)
4. **Execute the correct network-specific command**
5. **Provide network-specific guidance** and links

This prevents errors, wrong network usage, and ensures user intent is correctly executed across the multi-chain Omega Terminal environment.

## 🎯 AI DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK

### Quick Command Resolution Guide

**When user mentions these keywords, use these commands:**

**Trading Keywords → Actions:**

- "buy/sell tokens" → Ask for network, then use `solana buy/sell`, `near swap`, or `eclipse buy/sell`
- "check price" → Use `dexscreener <token>`, `cg <token>`, or `geckoterminal <token>`
- "my balance" → Use network-specific: `solana balance`, `balance`, `near wallet`
- "swap tokens" → Clarify network, then use appropriate swap command

**Wallet Keywords → Actions:**

- "connect wallet" → Ask for preference: `connect` (MetaMask), `solana connect` (Phantom), `near wallet`
- "wallet address" → Use `status` or network-specific balance commands
- "send tokens" → Use `send <address> <amount>` or `transfer <address> <amount>`

**Data Keywords → Actions:**

- "token analytics" → Use `dexscreener analytics` or `dexscreener token <address>`
- "market data" → Use `dexscreener trending` or `cg <token>`
- "price history" → Use analytics commands with specific token

**Entertainment Keywords → Actions:**

- "games" → Use `games` to show available options
- "fun features" → Suggest `arcade`, `flappy`, `omega-io`, `mystery-box`
- "change theme" → Use `theme <name>` with available options

**System Keywords → Actions:**

- "help" → Use `help` for command overview
- "clear terminal" → Use `clear` or `cls`
- "customize" → Use `theme <name>` or `profile` commands

### Error Prevention Guidelines

**Always verify before execution:**

1. **Network Confirmation**: Multi-network commands need user clarification
2. **Parameter Validation**: Ensure addresses/amounts are valid format
3. **Wallet Status**: Check if wallet connection needed first
4. **Token Existence**: Verify token symbols/addresses before trading

### Command Success Indicators

**User satisfaction signals:**

- Successful transaction hashes displayed
- Correct balance updates shown
- Requested data retrieved and formatted
- Theme/customization changes applied
- Games/entertainment features launched

This framework ensures accurate command execution while preventing common user errors and confusion.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Check server status** - Ensure Python HTTP server, Node.js relayer, and Polymarket proxy are running
2. **Verify browser console** - Check for JavaScript errors
3. **Test API connectivity** - Verify external API access
4. **Check wallet connection** - Ensure wallet is properly connected
