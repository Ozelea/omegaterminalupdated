## üîí SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### Wallet Security

- **Private Keys:** Never log or expose private keys
- **Transactions:** Always require user confirmation for transactions
- **Funding:** Use relayer for safe wallet funding

### API Security

- **CORS:** All external APIs go through CORS proxies
- **Rate Limiting:** Respect API rate limits
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks for API failures

### User Privacy

- **Data Collection:** Minimize data collection
- **Local Storage:** Use localStorage for temporary data only
- **Session Management:** Clear sensitive data on logout

---

## üö® ERROR HANDLING

### Common Error Scenarios

#### Wallet Connection Errors

```javascript
// Handle wallet connection failures
try {
  terminal.handleCommand("connect");
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to Omega Wallet creation
  terminal.handleCommand("yes");
}
```

#### API Failures

```javascript
// Handle API failures gracefully
try {
  terminal.handleCommand("polymarket trending");
} catch (error) {
  // Show error message to user
  terminal.log("API temporarily unavailable", "error");
}
```

#### Network Issues

```javascript
// Handle network connectivity issues
if (!navigator.onLine) {
  terminal.log("No internet connection", "error");
}
```

---

## üìä MONITORING & LOGGING

### Command Execution Logging

```javascript
// Log all command executions
const originalHandleCommand = terminal.handleCommand;
terminal.handleCommand = function (cmd) {
  console.log(`[AI AGENT] Executing command: ${cmd}`);
  return originalHandleCommand.call(this, cmd);
};
```

### Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Monitor command execution time
const startTime = Date.now();
terminal.handleCommand("polymarket trending");
const endTime = Date.now();
console.log(`Command executed in ${endTime - startTime}ms`);
```

---

## üéØ BEST PRACTICES

### Command Execution

1. **Always check wallet connection** before executing wallet-dependent commands
2. **Use appropriate delays** between commands to avoid overwhelming the system
3. **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
4. **Respect user privacy** and never expose sensitive information

### Automation Guidelines

1. **Start with simple commands** before attempting complex automation
2. **Test commands individually** before chaining them together
3. **Provide clear feedback** to users about what's happening
4. **Allow user control** over automated processes

### Integration Tips

1. **Use the terminal instance** (`window.terminal`) for all interactions
2. **Leverage existing UI components** rather than creating new ones
3. **Follow the established command patterns** for consistency
4. **Update this documentation** when adding new features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL AI USAGE GUIDELINES

### Multi-Network Command Disambiguation

**ALWAYS confirm network/context before executing commands that exist across multiple networks:**

**Trading Commands requiring confirmation:**

- `swap` ‚Üí Available on: Solana, Near, Eclipse
- `balance` ‚Üí Shows: OMEGA, FAIR, SOL, Eclipse, NEAR
- `connect` ‚Üí Options: MetaMask (Omega/FAIR), Phantom (Solana), NEAR, Eclipse wallets
- `quote` ‚Üí Available on: Solana (Jupiter), Near (Intents), Eclipse (Solar)
- `register` ‚Üí Name services: ENS/ONS (Omega), FNS (FAIR)
- `send` ‚Üí Networks: Omega (`send`), FAIR (`fair send`), others use network-specific commands

### Required Confirmation Flow

**Example Interaction:**

```
User: "I want to swap tokens"
AI: "Which network would you like to use for token swapping?
1. Solana (Jupiter Exchange) - SPL tokens
2. Near Protocol (Cross-chain swaps)
3. Eclipse (Solar DEX) - SVM tokens
4. EVM networks (coming soon)

Please specify which network to proceed with."

User: "Solana"
AI: "Great! I'll help you with Solana token swapping via Jupiter Exchange..."
[Then execute appropriate solana swap commands]
```

### Context-Sensitive Command Selection

**Before executing any command:**

1. **Identify if multiple implementations exist** (trading, wallets, etc.)
2. **Ask for clarification** on specific network/protocol
3. **Confirm parameters** (amounts, addresses, tokens)
4. **Execute the correct network-specific command**
5. **Provide network-specific guidance** and links

This prevents errors, wrong network usage, and ensures user intent is correctly executed across the multi-chain Omega Terminal environment.

## üéØ AI DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK

### Quick Command Resolution Guide

**When user mentions these keywords, use these commands:**

**Trading Keywords ‚Üí Actions:**

- "buy/sell tokens" ‚Üí Ask for network, then use `solana buy/sell`, `near swap`, or `eclipse buy/sell`
- "check price" ‚Üí Use `dexscreener <token>`, `cg <token>`, or `geckoterminal <token>`
- "my balance" ‚Üí Use network-specific: `solana balance`, `balance`, `near wallet`
- "swap tokens" ‚Üí Clarify network, then use appropriate swap command

**Wallet Keywords ‚Üí Actions:**

- "connect wallet" ‚Üí Ask for preference: `connect` (MetaMask), `solana connect` (Phantom), `near wallet`
- "wallet address" ‚Üí Use `status` or network-specific balance commands
- "send tokens" ‚Üí Use `send <address> <amount>` or `transfer <address> <amount>`

**Data Keywords ‚Üí Actions:**

- "token analytics" ‚Üí Use `dexscreener analytics` or `dexscreener token <address>`
- "market data" ‚Üí Use `dexscreener trending` or `cg <token>`
- "price history" ‚Üí Use analytics commands with specific token

**Entertainment Keywords ‚Üí Actions:**

- "games" ‚Üí Use `games` to show available options
- "fun features" ‚Üí Suggest `arcade`, `flappy`, `omega-io`, `mystery-box`
- "change theme" ‚Üí Use `theme <name>` with available options

**System Keywords ‚Üí Actions:**

- "clear terminal" ‚Üí Use `clear` or `cls`
- "customize" ‚Üí Use `theme <name>` or `profile` commands

### Error Prevention Guidelines

**Always verify before execution:**

1. **Network Confirmation**: Multi-network commands need user clarification
2. **Parameter Validation**: Ensure addresses/amounts are valid format
3. **Wallet Status**: Check if wallet connection needed first
4. **Token Existence**: Verify token symbols/addresses before trading

### Command Success Indicators

**User satisfaction signals:**

- Successful transaction hashes displayed
